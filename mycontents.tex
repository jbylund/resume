2013 --- Present\\
Senior Data Scientist \& Backend Engineer\\

\begin{itemize}[topsep=1ex, partopsep=0ex, parsep=0ex, itemsep=0.5ex]
    \item Numerous data driven API improvements which lead to 3-4x improvement in API latency as well as maximum request size.
    \item Contributed improvements to ORM (cakephp) and core php in order to reduce the number of queries necessary to render a page by 5x (decreasing page load time by \textasciitilde{}3x).
    \item Standardized deployment framework used to deploy thousands of servers of \textasciitilde{}30 different roles to AWS.
    \item Migrated primary non-statistical database (users, accounts, metadata) from MySQL to Postgres improving uptime \& flexability.
    \item Migrated primary statistical database (500 million rows/day) from non-first normal form to first normal form schema improving query latency, reducing storage demands and increasing throughput.
    \item Architechted and implemented sophisticated message routing system which is responsible for moving \textasciitilde{}40 billion events per day from our pixel servers to our real time processing servers while balancing cpu and memory constraints.
    \item Architechted and prototyped massively parallel decentralized data lake using AWS lambda and S3 for cost effective storage and low latency and cost effective queries.

Doctor of Philosophy - 2013 - Monte-Carlo Sampling of Protein-Ligand Interactions and Computational Improvements to Implicit Solvent Models\\
Master of Philosophy - 2010\\
Master of Arts - 2009\\

\begin{itemize}[topsep=1ex, partopsep=0ex, parsep=0ex, itemsep=0.5ex]
    \item Lead developer and maintainer ({\mytilde}80\% of source commits) of Protein Local Optimization Program (PLOP) project, a molecular mechanics library developed at Columbia University, University of California at San Francisco, and Schr\"{o}dinger.
    \item Designed and implemented the computational mutation scanning module of PLOP.
    \item Rehabilitated project from non-compiling state on arrival.
    \item Redesigned build system to automatically determine dependencies and take advantage of parallel compilation, reducing build time from {\mytilde}30 minutes to {\mytilde}3 minutes and greatly accelerating development.
    \item Created a small molecule database representing 95\%+ of small molecules in the Protein Data Bank, extending PLOP from a protein-only program to a general molecular mechanics toolkit.
    \item Designed and implemented a Perl based automated regression testing framework, which accelerated development while minimizing bugs and regressions.
    \item Created a project wiki, combining scattered documentation and completing missing documentation.

\begin{itemize}[topsep=1ex, partopsep=0ex, parsep=0ex, itemsep=0.5ex]
    \item Designed and implemented two methods of combining information from multiple crystal structures into a single "composite motif". These combined motifs increased sensitivity and specificity of motif matching algorithms.
    \item Completed senior thesis project identifying homologous pseudogenes in human and chimpanzee, and determining differential mutation rates.
