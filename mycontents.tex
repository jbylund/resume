\textbf{Experience}

\myfontsize{\bodysize}
\textbf{Columbia University}, New York, NY\\
2007 --- Present\\
Graduate Student Researcher\\
\begin{itemize}[topsep=1ex, partopsep=0ex, parsep=0ex, itemsep=0.5ex]
    \item Lead developer and maintainer ({\mytilde}80\% of source commits) of Protein Local Optimization Program (PLOP) project, a molecular mechanics library developed at Columbia University, University of California at San Francisco, and Schr\"{o}dinger.
    \item Designed and implemented the computational mutation scanning module of PLOP.
    \item Rehabilitated project from non-compiling state on arrival.
    \item Redesigned build system to automatically determine dependencies and take advantage of parallel compilation, reducing build time from {\mytilde}30 minutes to {\mytilde}3 minutes and greatly accelerating development.
    \item Created a small molecule database representing 95\%+ of small molecules in the Protein Data Bank, extending PLOP from a protein-only program to a general molecular mechanics toolkit.
    \item Designed and implemented a Perl based automated regression testing framework, which accelerated development while minimizing bugs and regressions.
    \item Created a project wiki, combining scattered documentation and completing missing documentation.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{\mybigskip}

\textbf{Shotwell Project, Yorba Foundation}\\
2012 --- Present\\
Community Contributor\\
\begin{itemize}[topsep=1ex, partopsep=0ex, parsep=0ex, itemsep=0.5ex]
    \item Contributed a number of new features and bug fixes to the Shotwell photo organizer program.
    \item Recursively included contained files in the folder browser.
    \item Added support of panoramic images as event thumbnails.
    \item Updated searches to search comments and robustly treat accented characters.
    \item Fixed a number of UI experiences such as adding icons to buttons and windows, and correcting misleading text.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Rice University}\\
2006 --- 2007\\
Undergraduate Researcher, Department of Computer Science\\ 
\begin{itemize}[topsep=1ex, partopsep=0ex, parsep=0ex, itemsep=0.5ex]
    \item Designed and implemented two methods of combining information from multiple crystal structures into a single "composite motif". These combined motifs increased sensitivity and specificity of motif matching algorithms.
    \item Completed senior thesis project identifying homologous pseudogenes in human and chimpanzee, and determining differential mutation rates.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{\mybigskip}
\textbf{MITRE}\\
2005 --- 2006\\
Intern\\
\begin{itemize}[topsep=1ex, partopsep=0ex, parsep=0ex, itemsep=0.5ex]
    \item Created a PHP/mySQL web application to dynamically generate a map representing operational status of ADS-B (Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast, used for flight navigation) ground stations.
\end{itemize}
