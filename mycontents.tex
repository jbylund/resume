New York, NY\\
2013 --- Present\\
Senior Data Scientist \& Back-end Engineer\\

\begin{itemize}[topsep=1ex, partopsep=0ex, parsep=0ex, itemsep=0.5ex]
    \item Designed and implemented distributed, fault tolerant ETL reducing cost by an order of magnitude, increasing reliability and reducing processing time from {\mytilde}10 hours to {\mytilde}1 hour, making data available to clients far earlier in the day (using python, SQS, Redis, PostgreSQL).
    \item Numerous data driven API improvements which lead to 3-4x improvement in API latency as well as maximum request size (PHP, CakePHP).
    \item Contributed improvements to ORM (CakePHP) and core PHP in order to reduce the number of queries necessary to render a page by 5x (decreasing page load time by {\mytilde}3x) (CakePHP, c).
    \item Standardized deployment framework used to deploy thousands of servers of {\mytilde}30 different roles to AWS (AWS, EC2, boto3).
    \item Migrated primary non-statistical database (users, accounts, metadata) from MySQL to PostgreSQL improving uptime \& flexibility (MySQL, PostgreSQL, foreign data wrappers).
    \item Migrated primary statistical database (500 million rows/day) from non-first normal form to first normal form schema improving query latency, reducing storage demands and increasing throughput.
    \item Architected and implemented sophisticated message routing system which is responsible for moving {\mytilde}40 billion events per day from our pixel servers to our real time processing servers while balancing CPU and memory constraints (c++).
    \item Architected and prototyped massively parallel decentralized data lake using AWS lambda and S3 for cost effective storage and low latency and cost effective queries (AWS lambda, python, PostgreSQL).

New York, NY\\
2007 --- 2013, GPA 3.9/4.0\\
Integrated Program In Cellular, Molecular and Biomedical Studies\\
Doctor of Philosophy - 2013 - Monte-Carlo Sampling of Protein-Ligand Interactions and Computational Improvements to Implicit Solvent Models\\
Master of Philosophy - 2010\\
Master of Arts - 2009\\

\begin{itemize}[topsep=1ex, partopsep=0ex, parsep=0ex, itemsep=0.5ex]
    \item Lead developer and maintainer ({\mytilde}80\% of source commits) of Protein Local Optimization Program (PLOP) project, a molecular mechanics library developed at Columbia University, University of California at San Francisco, and Schr\"{o}dinger (fortran).
    \item Designed and implemented the computational mutation scanning module of PLOP.
    \item Rehabilitated project from non-compiling state on arrival.
    \item Redesigned build system to automatically determine dependencies and take advantage of parallel compilation, reducing build time from {\mytilde}30 minutes to {\mytilde}3 minutes and greatly accelerating development.
    \item Created a small molecule database representing 95\%+ of small molecules in the Protein Data Bank, extending PLOP from a protein-only program to a general molecular mechanics toolkit.
    \item Designed and implemented a Perl based automated regression testing framework, which accelerated development while minimizing bugs and regressions.
    \item Created a project wiki, combining scattered documentation and completing missing documentation.

\myfontsize{\bodysize}
Houston, TX\\
2003 --- 2007, GPA 3.7/4.0\\
Bachelor of Arts - Mathematics\\
Bachelor of Science - Biology (Ecology and Evolutionary Biology)\\
Relevant coursework: Machine Learning, Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations, Real and Complex Analysis, Combinatorics, Number Theory, Mathematical Logic, Modern Algebra, Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometry.
\begin{itemize}[topsep=1ex, partopsep=0ex, parsep=0ex, itemsep=0.5ex]
    \item Designed and implemented two methods of combining information from multiple crystal structures into a single "composite motif". These combined motifs increased sensitivity and specificity of motif matching algorithms.
    \item Completed senior thesis project identifying homologous pseudogenes in human and chimpanzee, and determining differential mutation rates.
